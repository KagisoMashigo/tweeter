# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a sleek, simple, single-page Twitter clone.

The technologies used include HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX along with Node, Express and MongoDB. The page itself is dynamic and will post tweets you create to the page and store them until you reset your server. There are 3 stock tweets to begin with.
